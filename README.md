# D3.2 - Design recommendations for user interfaces to interact with digital twins

Interoperability of open research data from experimental and simulation workflows in a FAIR manner hinges on proper treatment of samples in a digital infrastructure. This repository contains a living document developed (and updated) throughout the PREMISE project reflecting the experiences of the team in designing user interfaces to interact with so-called digital twins - the digital representations of physical samples used in experiments.

You may read the document [here](design-recommendations.md).

## Goal

The goal of this deliverable is to provide insight to future researchers interested in facilitating interoperability between experimental research data management systems and workflow management systems in an effort to streamline scientific discovery.

## Achievement

The design recommendations for user interfaces to interact with digital twins is provided in the [D3.2 pdf file](https://github.com/ord-premise/digital-twins-interface-design/blob/main/D3.2.pdf). First official assessment of the validity/applicability of the recommendations and guidelines will come at the project's halfmark.
